# Find the maximum number in a list

# Find the minimum number in a list



# Create an empty list called my_list.
# Add integers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) to the list.
# Print the list.
# Remove the even numbers from the list.
# Print the modified list.

# Create a list with custom range from the user eg : 5
# collect the input from the user as well and store it in the list
# calculate the sum of all inputs in the list and print the result



# Create a list with user inputs
# create another list from the original list to store even numbers only
# similarly create another list to store the odd numbers


# Create a list original_list containing integers from 1 to 20.
# Use slicing to extract the following sublists:
# Elements from index 5 to index 15 (inclusive).
# Elements from index 0 to index 10 (exclusive).
# Elements starting from index 15 to the end of the list.
# Print all the extracted sublists.


# Create a list with 10 names as values
# The user will give a name, check if the name is present in the list or not
# if present , remove the name and print the name is successfully removed
# if not present, print the name is not present in the list


# Write a program to find the first occurrence of a number divisible by 7 and stop the loop
# Print all numbers from 1 to 10 except multiples of 3

# Create a program that checks if a number is odd and prints the number. If it's even, do nothing

# Write a program to check if a letter is present in a string or not
